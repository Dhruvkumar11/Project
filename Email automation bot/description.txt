Itâ€™s a voice command typing email which sent the emails automatically.
I have used python language and some of its packages like text to
speech,speech recognition,pycharm and smtp (Standard email transfer protocol).
In this program, the bot will ask you several questions like,
1.Whom you want to send the email
2.What is the subject of your email
3.What is the message of your email which you want to send.
And you will reply to the bot whenever he asks you these questions.
If you provide the correct information then the mail will automatically send
